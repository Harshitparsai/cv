            This Project was made to enhance my skills in understanding the
            python and get hands on practice in OPPs and Tkinter while learning
            the Python. In this project a student can calculte the cgpa and can
            also predict his/her cgpa for upcomming semester .My motive to make
            this project was to enable the student to get to know what may be
            the expected cgpa and how much they have to study In order to get
            their disired CGPA.

          <p>
            This is very intellegent and the useful Machiene Learning model.
            This can detect if the type of the cancer in the women is dangerous
            or not and it was even faster and accurate then doctor. Mainly used
            technogoies are Machine learning and Deep Learning to process the
            dataset and make the neural network.Dataset of the images as the
            16*16 pixel of the cancers tumer was given and I processed it in
            such a way that if a new image comes then it can tell if it is
            dangerous or not
